# GTFO-Datablock-Edit-Helper

Features:
  - Normal replace
  - RegEx replace
  - Saving output every operation with adjustable naming
  - Convenient to use

Work In Progress

Compile with auto-py-to-exe with --onedir yourself to avoid .exe being falsely tagged as virus by windows etc





I know you can do almost the same in n++ but my creation features automatic saves after every operation and goes through the most useful knowledge of RegEx that comes in handy for next-level editing of GTFO DataBlocks

im new to python, give me a break about my code not being perfect in every aspect
